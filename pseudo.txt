1) For each value in statements list
2) Split value by period
    1) If value from statement ends in period, the last split value is a path
      1) remove last split value
      2) if length of split value is 1
        1) Search through classes for the object using keyword
        2) If object is empty, it is an empty class
          1) append empty list to output
        3) if object is dict
          1) sort and append top 5 keys to output
        4) If object is list
          1) sort and append top 5 values to output
      3) if length of split value is more than 1. eg "Order.allocations.". It is an polymorphic type
        1) Append empty list in output
    2) If value from statements does not end in period, the last split value is a parameter to compare with
      1) If length of split value is 2
        1) Search thourgh classes for the object using the second last split value as keyword
        2) If object is empty, it is an empty class
          1) append empty list to output
        3) If object is dict
          1) get all keys that matches the parameter
          2) sort and append to output
        4) if object is list
          1) get all value that matches the paremeter
          2) sort and append to output
      2) If length of split value is more than 2. It is a polymorphic type
       1) append empty list in output
